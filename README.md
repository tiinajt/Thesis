# Thesis
This repository is dedicated to my MSc thesis project: Integrated multi-omic characterization of human bone marrow natural killer cells in healthy subjects and hematological disease patients

# WP1:

-	CITE-seq antibody signal evaluation for Neurips, Seurat and Granja datasets
-	CITE-seq antibody signal evaluation for aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples of Easigenomics datasets
-	Comparison of antibody signal strengths between different analyzing laboratories (Neurips)
-	Clustering of AA, MDS and AML samples to identify NK and B cell clusters for comparison
-	Comparison of DSB and CLR normalization methods for ADT data (DSB only available for Easigenomics)

# WP2: 
-	Comparisons of UMAPs based on RNA, ADT or latent space (Neurips, Seurat)
-	Analysis of relationship of RNA and corresponding surface protein expression 
-	Regression models to find surface protein markers for NK cell subsets

# WP3:
-	Clustering of NK cells from healthy donors (Neurips) +  identification of marker genes
-	Clustering of NK cells from AA, MDS and AML donors (Easigenomics) + identification of marker genes
